AI-driven autonomous penetration testing framework with policy-constrained full-auto execution and optional human oversight. Executes a full offensive engagement pipeline — OSINT → exploitation — using an LLM (DeepSeek API or local Ollama).

Benchmark and evaluation results in this repository are self-scored engineering
measurements. They are not independent third-party validation and do not support
claims that omitest outperforms another security agent. See
`benchmarks/manifest.json` for the comparison policy.

## Recommended OS

**Kali Linux** (all pentest tools pre-installed). Any Debian/Ubuntu-based distro with the standard security toolchain also works. macOS and plain Windows are not recommended.

**RAM:** at least **8GB**, whether Kali is bare-metal or a VM. Below that, the backend/frontend/Metasploit/nmap combination — especially during a long-running autonomous session — can push the system into swap and make the UI (including clicking Approve) feel like it's hanging. If you're running a local Ollama model instead of a cloud API provider, budget several GB more on top of the 8GB baseline for the model itself (a 7B model needs roughly 6-8GB, 14B roughly 12-16GB).

## Architecture

```
Streamlit Frontend  (port 8501)
         │
FastAPI Backend     (port 6000)
   Orchestrator │ Scanner │ AI Connector │ SQLite DB
         │               │               │
   AI Engine         Nmap/NSE        Shell Exec
  DeepSeek/Ollama   VulnScripts      (Kali env)
```

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, Nmap (`sudo apt install nmap`), Ollama, or an API key for DeepSeek, OpenAI/ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, or OpenRouter.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaungkhantko26/omitest.git
cd omitest
./start.sh
```

`start.sh` creates the venv, installs dependencies, resolves port conflicts, and launches both services.

---

## Quick Start

1. Run `./start.sh`
2. Open `http://localhost:8501`
3. **Settings → AI Configuration** — connect Ollama or DeepSeek API key
4. **New Session** — enter target IP / domain and confirm authorization
5. Watch the session timeline advance through engagement phases
6. Review **AI Decisions** — approve or let auto-approve handle it
7. Monitor **Scan Results**, **Vulnerabilities**, **Credentials** as findings accumulate

---

## Configuration

### AI — Ollama (local or remote)

```env
AI_PROVIDER=local
OLLAMA_URL=http://192.168.1.50:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_WINDOW=32768
```

Remote Ollama host: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve`

### AI — DeepSeek API

```env
AI_PROVIDER=api
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat
```

### AI — OpenAI / ChatGPT API

```env
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### AI — Anthropic Claude API

```env
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
```

### AI — OpenRouter

```env
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
OPENROUTER_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

### AI — OpenAI-compatible gateway

Use **Settings → AI Configuration → OpenAI-Compatible API**, or configure it
with environment variables. The base URL may end at `/v1` or include the full
`/chat/completions` path; the connector normalizes both forms.

```env
AI_PROVIDER=compatible
COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL=https://globalblamp.vercel.app/v1
COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=gk-replace-with-your-rotated-key
COMPATIBLE_MODEL=gpt-5.4
```

Use **Test connection** in the web settings before saving. The test verifies
the URL, key, selected model, response shape, and reports round-trip latency.
Transient gateway errors are retried automatically, and custom gateways that
reject optional OpenAI parameters receive a minimal compatibility request.

Keys are stored only in the gitignored `.env` file. If a key has been posted in
chat, an issue, or a terminal transcript, revoke it and create a replacement.

Set `AI_PROVIDER=none` to run without an LLM. In that mode deterministic scan,
playbook, policy, verification, and reporting paths remain available; LLM-only
creative exploit selection is explicitly reported as unavailable rather than
silently guessed.

### Ports

```env
BACKEND_PORT=6000
FRONTEND_PORT=8501
```

### VPS deployment

Keep the backend and Streamlit listener on `127.0.0.1`; do not expose the
command-execution API directly to the internet. A hardened systemd service and
an nginx TLS/basic-auth reverse-proxy example are in [`deploy/vps`](deploy/vps/README.md).

### Security

```env
API_AUTH_TOKEN=          # auto-generated on first run
BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1
REQUIRE_APPROVAL_HIGH_RISK=true
APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=15
SCOPE_ALLOWLIST=10.0.0.0/8,lab.local
```

### Full Auto Mode

```env
FULL_AUTO_MODE=false   # true = no approval prompts — isolated labs only
# Automated execution policy and the binary allowlist remain active in full-auto mode.
```

### Advanced tuning (optional)

All have sensible defaults; set only if needed.

# AI reply budget + determinism (DeepSeek API / Ollama)
AI_MAX_TOKENS=4096        # cap on a single AI reply; too small truncates the JSON
TACTICAL_TEMPERATURE=0.2  # low = fewer hallucinated flags/CVEs for command choice

# Reverse-shell callback routing — a shell only works if the TARGET can reach your
# listener. On a LAN lab the local IP works; a real internet target behind NAT needs
# a reachable callback (public IP, ngrok tunnel, or a reverse-SSH endpoint).
CALLBACK_MODE=auto        # auto | local | public | ngrok | manual
EXPLOIT_LHOST=            # explicit callback host (VPS public IP / tunnel endpoint)
EXPLOIT_LPORT=4444        # callback + local listener port
EXPLOIT_PAYLOAD=          # default: guessed from target OS
NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=          # required for CALLBACK_MODE=ngrok

# CVE enrichment + exploitability ranking.
NVD_API_KEY=             # https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
NVD_MIN_INTERVAL=6.5     # seconds between NVD calls when no key is set
MSF_CVE_RESOLVE=true     # resolve CVE -> Metasploit module via local msfconsole
MSF_CVE_RESOLVE_LIMIT=3  # how many top-priority CVEs to resolve per pass

# Optional session-aware Metasploit RPC transport. Leave empty to use the
# managed msfconsole transport. Requires msgrpc and the msgpack dependency.
MSFRPC_URL=
MSFRPC_USER=msf
MSFRPC_PASSWORD=
MSFRPC_TOKEN=

# Scan / command timeouts (seconds)
SCAN_TIMEOUT=300
# Use Nmap OS fingerprinting when the backend has raw-packet privileges; the
# framework falls back to service/banner evidence for unprivileged runs.
NMAP_OS_DETECTION=true
VULN_SCAN_TIMEOUT=120
VULN_SCAN_CONCURRENCY=4  # bounded parallel per-port NSE scans
COMMAND_TIMEOUT=600
# Autonomous execution is argv-first. Enable these only inside an isolated lab
# if a workflow genuinely requires shell composition or an interpreter.
AUTONOMOUS_SHELL_COMPOSITION=false
AUTONOMOUS_RUNTIME_COMMANDS=false

# Agentic-loop safety
MAX_AUTO_PIVOTS=12       # auto-pivots before pausing for manual review
MAX_EMPTY_RETRIES=3      # retries when the model returns no command
WATCHDOG_STALL_SECONDS=  # default: COMMAND_TIMEOUT + 180 (stuck-session revival)

# OSINT stage hold (public domain/host targets) — stops OSINT being skipped after
# one turn. Advances once enough OSINT tools have run, or the turn cap is hit.
OSINT_MIN_ACTIONS=3      # distinct OSINT tools before leaving the OSINT stage
OSINT_MAX_TURNS=6        # hard cap so a low-OSINT target still advances

# Coverage engine — methodology-driven per-service playbooks, known-exploit hints,
# coverage-derived progress. ON by default; toggle live in Settings → Engine Features
# (no .env editing needed). Target-agnostic.
COVERAGE_ENGINE=true

# Decoupled brute-force worker — background credential brute-force on discovered
# auth services (SSH/FTP/RDP/MySQL/SMB/WinRM). Explicit opt-in; toggle in Settings.
BRUTEFORCE_ENABLED=false   # explicit opt-in; may trigger account lockouts
BRUTEFORCE_TIER=default            # default | rockyou | full
BRUTEFORCE_MAX_SECONDS_PER_SERVICE=600
BRUTEFORCE_CONCURRENCY=2
```

> **Tip:** Coverage Engine, Brute-force, and Full-Auto mode can be toggled at
> runtime from **Settings → Engine Features** — changes apply immediately and are
> saved to `.env` automatically, so end users never need to edit files.

## Session Retention

Sessions persist their lifecycle events, background jobs, scan state, findings,
and asset relationships in SQLite. The dashboard can export a portable session
archive containing the report, event timeline, job records, and manifest:

```text
GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/archive
GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/events
GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/jobs
POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/cancel
```

Independent NSE and ExploitDB lookups use bounded concurrency. State-dependent
exploitation and post-exploitation actions remain ordered. Public targets do not
receive a private workstation callback address unless a reachable callback mode
or explicit public endpoint is configured.
