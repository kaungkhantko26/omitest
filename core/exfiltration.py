"""
omitest Data Exfiltration Module (Roadmap feature)

Stealthy, staged extraction of confirmed loot. Pure data + helpers — no I/O, no
orchestrator coupling — so it is unit-testable and safe to import anywhere.

Design: once the engagement has a foothold and confirmed sensitive data, the
operator/AI should move it out without triggering detection. This module provides
a declarative checklist of exfiltration techniques (each with an OPSEC note) and
a command builder for the common transports. The tactical loop is surfaced these
via a prompt context block; it still selects and runs the concrete commands.

Default behaviour is bounded and safe: every command embeds only the operator's
reachable callback/loot host and never exfiltrates by default (it is surfaced as
a methodology, not auto-executed). EXFIL_ENABLED gates any automatic dispatch.
