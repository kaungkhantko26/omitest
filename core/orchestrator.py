- Auto-approve enabled: {session.auto_approve}
- Auto-execution depth counter: {session.auto_depth_counter}/{session.max_auto_depth}

CRITICAL RULE: If a Target Domain is provided ({session.target_domain}), you MUST use the domain name in your suggested commands (especially for web tools like gobuster, curl, ffuf, etc.), NEVER the IP address, to ensure Virtual Host and SNI routing work correctly.

ANALYSIS REQUIRED:
1. Why did the command fail? (missing tool, wrong syntax, permission issue, network error, etc.)
2. What is the corrected command that will work?
3. Follow the strict methodologies from SYSTEM_PROMPT

IMPORTANT: Your suggested command MUST be non-interactive and follow all methodology rules.
